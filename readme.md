# Astonia Community Client

This is the community client for Astonia 3. It is based on, and compatible
with, the [client maintained by Daniel Brockhaus](https://github.com/DanielBrockhaus/astonia_client).

The main goal is to allow community driven development.

Further goals:

- Maintain backwards compatibility with the original game server.
- Maintain compatibility with all servers currently using the client.
- Keep it simple. No additional libraries, frameworks or tools unless absolutely needed.
- Whenever possible, put bugfixes in single commits for easy cherry-picking.
- Always have a downloadable Windows release with sensible hardware requirements and no software requirements.
- Work towards supporting more / all of the servers.

## Build

### Windows

Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). It comes with three shells, launch the clang 64 one (not aarch64).

Install dependencies:
```bash
pacman -Syu
pacman -Sy mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-libpng mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-libzip mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-mimalloc mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-ninja make zip mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-dwarfstack mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-zig mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-rustup
rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm
```

**Note**: SDL3 and SDL3_mixer will be automatically compiled from source during the build if not found.

### Linux

Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel sdl3-git sdl3_mixer-git libpng libzip zlib mimalloc zig rust
```


Or use Docker (no dependencies needed):
```bash
make docker-linux
```

### AppImage (Universal Linux Binary)

Build a portable AppImage that runs on any Linux distribution:

```bash
make appimage
```

This creates `astonia-client.AppImage` which bundles all dependencies (including SDL3) and works on any modern Linux distribution without installation.

**Requirements**: FUSE2 must be installed to run AppImages. Most distributions include it by default, but if needed:
```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S fuse2

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libfuse2
```

To run the AppImage:
```bash
chmod +x astonia-client-*.AppImage
./astonia-client-*.AppImage
```

Alternatively, extract and run without FUSE:
```bash
./astonia-client-*.AppImage --appimage-extract
./squashfs-root/AppRun
```

### macOS

Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
brew install cmake ninja zig libpng zlib libzip mimalloc rust
```

**Note**: SDL3 and SDL3_mixer will be automatically compiled from source during the build if not found.

## Commands

```bash
make            # Build for current platform
make zig-build  # Build using Zig
make distrib    # Create distribution package
make amod       # Build mod (src/amod/)
make clean      # Clean up build assets
```

## Development & Quality Checks

Run quality checks locally before committing (same checks as CI pipeline):

```bash
make lint       # Auto-fix code formatting
make check      # Run all quality checks
```


## Testing

To run tests:

```bash
make test
```
